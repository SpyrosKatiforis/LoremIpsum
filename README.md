# Lorem Ipsum XML Processing Project

This is a standalone Java project that demonstrates text parsing, XML generation, XSD schema generation, and XML validation.

The project processes a `.txt` file to:
- Parse its content into structured `Book`, `Chapter`, `Paragraph`, and `Line` objects.
- Marshal the structured content into an XML file.
- Generate an XSD schema from the `Book` model.
- Validate the generated XML file against the XSD schema.
- Present specific elements from the parsed text.

## Requirements
**Java**

### Text File Requirement
The application requires a specific `.txt` file for parsing. This file should be located in the **Downloads** folder of your system. You can download the required text file from the following link:
- [Download Text File](https://github.com/iracleous/xmlDemo/blob/master/xml_files/sample-lorem-ipsum-text-file.txt)

Please ensure the text file is placed in the following path on your machine: C:/Users/admin/Downloads/sample-lorem-ipsum-text-file.txt

If you'd like to use a different path for the text file, you can change the path in the `main` method of the `LoremIpsum.java` class.
